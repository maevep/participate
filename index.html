The movie I’ve picked is a Georges Méliès film: The Haunted Castle. I chose this film because first, I absolutely love Méliès. I have a huge love for special effects, and Méliès was basically the leader of this in the early era of film. Second, I love horror, it’s my favorite genre of film. This film is a short look into the horrors of the 1890s. Also it’s just funny. I think it’s very game-like as well, with multiple varying enemies. 
	The game will be set up as a side scroller as a man moving through a castle. Different enemies, bats, ghosts, and skeletons will come from the side (summoned by the devil). The player will have to avoid and kill these enemies as it moves through. I will use the up and down keys and the spacebar to shoot. 

Sprites: bat, devil, man, skeleton, ghost (chorus?), woman-old lady, cross, background
